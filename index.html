  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Goeiedag, Bonjour, Hello,</p>
  <p>My name is Mikael and I am currently in the process of learning how to be a web developer by following a comprehensive course on Udemy called "The complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" taught by Dr. Angela Yu</p>
  <p>As part of the course I'm encouraged to complete a few captstone projects that I can later add to my online portfolio. This resume is one of them.</p>
  <p>I am currently employed as a software test engineer in a pharmaceutical company and I have great colleagues. My job however, is not challenging enough and I would like to learn how to solve problems rather than look for the problems which is what a software tester essentially does.</p>
  <p>For a long time I've been thinking about taking the course and now I've finally started hoping that it will add value to my career. Feel free to look around and contact me if you're interested in my resume.</p>
